----------
Quick Start
----------
1. Download from [https://certifytheweb.com/](https://certifytheweb.com/) and install it.
2. Click 'New Certificate', choose your IIS site (which must have 1 or more hostname bindings set). Save your settings and click 'Request Certificate'
3. All done!

Advanced users can explore the different validation modes, deployment modes and other advanced options.

Developer Build/Run Requirements:
----------------------

> - Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition (or higher) 
> - A local instance of IIS installed (for http validation, not required for DNS validation).
> - To build the current release version use the release branch: https://github.com/webprofusion/certify/tree/release, development is the current work in progress.
> - Restoring NuGet packages using "Update-Package -reinstall" can be useful where nuget restore fails.
> - The app needs to run as Administrator, otherwise it cannot access IIS, write to the IIS website root paths or manage the windows certificate store.
> - The UI needs the background service to be running. You can configure Visual Studio to launch both the Certify.UI project and the Certify.Service project via Solution > Properties > Multiple Startup Projects

> **Note:**  For development you will require a publicly accessible IP mapped to the domain/subdomain you want to test with. The Let's Encrypt service will need to be able to access your test site remotely via HTTP in order to complete authorisation challenges.
> The app consists of a UI and background service. The background service must be running for the UI to operate.
